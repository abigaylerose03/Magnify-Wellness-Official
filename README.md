# Project

## Getting Started

**Dependencies**

- Have Node installed

1. Clone the repo and `cd` into root
2. `npm install` to install dependencies associated
3. `npm run dev` to start development server

For production cases you `npm run build` and then `npm run start`

## What I'm doing

**Updating this repository**

Have 2 initiatives:

1. Convert this repo into proper production repository (Should not be using raw HTML/CSS. Use a framework)
2. Organize this repository

## What I'm Using

1. Using ReactJS library and NextJS framework
2. Using TailwindCSS
